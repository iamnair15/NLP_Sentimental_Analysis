# NLP_Sentimental_Analysis
Creating Sentiment Analysis in AI involves several steps. Below is a simplified outline of the process:

Data Collection: Gather a labeled dataset containing text samples with corresponding sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing noise, special characters, and stopwords. Convert the text into a suitable format for analysis (e.g., tokenization).

Feature Extraction: Represent the text data as numerical features that the AI model can understand. Common techniques include word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or using pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, GPT).

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate model architecture for sentiment analysis. Popular choices include recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer-based models.

Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. Utilize techniques like mini-batch gradient descent and backpropagation to optimize the model's parameters.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameter settings to improve the model's performance. This includes learning rate, batch size, and number of layers.
